The  Tamagotchi app is all about returning the entertainment and happiness of having a virtual pet, just like the infamous toy from the 90s. It's a simple and fun involvement in that it lets users take care for their digital confidante straight from their mobile device. The core purpose of this app is to give users a virtual pet-holding experience that's both sentimental and accessible. By simulating the responsibilities of pet care in a virtual form, the app permits users to love the company of a digital pet without the requirement for physical toys or devices. Through an uncomplicated and user-friendly interface, your app allows users to engage with their digital pet through simpler actions such as feeding, playing, and cleaning. By tapping on buttons labeled "feed," "clean," and "play," users can carry out these actions and see their pet respond accordingly. Each interaction allows animations and updates to reflect the pet's current status and needs, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for users. Whether they're feeding their pet, playing with it, or cleaning it thoroughly, users are actively involved in the care and well-being of their virtual pet. One of the main features of this app is its simplicity. The interface is made to be intuitive and easy to navigate, making it reachable to users of all ages and skill levels. Whether they're younger children or old adults reliving their childhood memories, anyone can love looking after their virtual pet with your app. By tapping into the nostalgia of the main Tamagotchi game, the app charms a wide range of fans who longingly remember caring for their virtual pets in the 90s. It's a sentimental trip down memory lane for some and a fun new experience for others who may be discovering the joys of virtual pet ownership for the first time.

In making a Tamagotchi app, how it looks and works really is important. The first screen is where the user starts, and the second screen is where the user takes care of your pet. First, on the starting screen, I  want to catch the user’s eye and get the user excited and happy. It is like opening the door to a new world. The layout is very very simple, like a list from top to bottom. The background is like a cool picture that makes you feel happy and ready to play with a cute cat waving at the user. There's a huge "START GAME!!" button in the middle that you can't miss. When you press it, you're set to take care of your digital pet. Secondly, the second screen is where the real fun happens. It's set up just like the first screen, so you know where everything and its functions are. Here, the user sees their pet doing different things, like playing or eating. It's like watching a little movie of the user’s pet's life. Below that are buttons to do things like clean, feed, and play with the user’s pet. It's similar to having a remote control for the user’s pet! The user can see how the user’s pet is feeling as well, with the status update that tells you if it's healthy, hungry, or needs a bath.

GitHub was used to upload this app. Firstly, begin by creating an account on GitHub account some time ago. Then, on GitHub’s website, I created a repository for the project and gave it a name.  I wrote a Readme file and pushed my project each time. GitHub Actions helps check if the code works correctly or turns the code into a finished product
